# Cofix

Cofix gem is meant to present the user with 10 popular cities in the US,
Let the user pick one from a list, and then introduce him to the best coffee shop in this city,
as well as its personal website.

It could be used as a great, quick tool for somebody who loves traveling and coffee,
who is in one of these cities and doesn't have much time to research the best coffee shops around.

It will quickly give him this information,
as well as the store's webpage for more information.   

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cofix'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cofix

## Usage

Cofix will present the user with a list of 10 popular cities in the US,
from which he will have to choose - by typing in a number between 1-10
Then he will be asked if he would like to see the chosen city's best coffee shop and its website
by typing in YES/Y/NO/N.
